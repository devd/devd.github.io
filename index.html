    <div class='abstract'>
We   provide   the   first   treatment   of   typo-tolerant password
authentication  for  arbitrary  user-selected  passwords. Such a system, rather
than simply rejecting a login attempt withan  incorrect  password,  tries  to
correct  common  typographical errors  on  behalf  of  the  user.  Limited
forms  of  typo-tolerance have  been  used  in  some  industry  settings,  but
to  date  there  has been no analysis of the utility and security of such
schemes. We  quantify  the  kinds  and  rates  of  typos  made  by  users
viastudies  conducted  on  Amazon  Mechanical  Turk  and  via  instrumentation
of  the  production  login  infrastructure  at  Dropbox. The instrumentation at
Dropbox did not record user passwords or otherwise change authentication policy,
but recorded only the frequency of observed typos. Our experiments reveal that
almost 10%  of  login  attempts  fail  due  to  a  handful  of  simple,
easily correctable  typos,  such  as  capitalization  errors.  We  show
that correcting  just  a  few  of  these  typos  would  reduce  login  delays for
a significant fraction of users as well as enable an additional 3% of users to
achieve successful login. We introduce a framework for reasoning about
typo-tolerance, and  investigate  the  seemingly  inherent  tension  here
between security  and  usability  of  passwords.  We  use  our  framework
to show  that  there  exist  typo-tolerant  authentication  schemes  that can
get  corrections  for  “free”:  we  prove  they  are  as  secure  as schemes
that always reject mistyped passwords. Building off this theory,  we  detail  a
variety  of  practical  strategies  for  securely implementing typo-tolerance.

A number of recent research and industry proposals discussed using encrypted
data in web applications. We first present a systematization of the design
space of web applications and highlight the advantages and limitations of
current proposals. Next, we present ShadowCrypt, a previously unexplored design
point that enables encrypted input/output without trusting any part of the web
applications. ShadowCrypt allows users to transparently switch to encrypted
input/output for text-based web applications. ShadowCrypt runs as a browser
extension, replacing input elements in a page with secure, isolated shadow
inputs and encrypted text with secure, isolated cleartext. ShadowCrypt’s key
innovation is the use of Shadow DOM, an upcoming primitive that allows
low-overhead isolation of DOM trees. Evaluation results indicate that 
ShadowCrypt has low overhead and of practical use today. Finally, based on our
experience with ShadowCrypt, we present a study of 17 popular web applications,
across different domains, and the functionality impact and security advantages
of encrypting the data they handle.

    <div class='abstract'>

  Clickjacking is a powerful attack against modern web applications. While browser primitives like X-Frame-Options
  provide a rigorous defense for simple applications, mashups
  such as social media widgets require secure user interaction
  while embedded in an untrusted webpage. Motivated by
  these application scenarios, the W3C UI safety specification
  proposes new browser primitives to provide a strong defense
  against clickjacking attacks on embedded widgets. We investigate whether these proposed primitives provide requisite
  security against clickjacking. We observe that UI security
  attacks such as clickjacking are fundamentally attacks on
  human perception. Revisiting clickjacking from a perceptual
  perspective, we develop five novel attacks that completely
  bypass the proposed UI safety specification. Our attacks
  are powerful with success rates ranging from 20% to 99%.
  However, they only scratch the surface of possible perceptual attacks on UI security. We discuss possible defenses
  against our perceptual attacks and find that most defenses
  either have an unacceptable usability cost or do not provide
  a comprehensive defense. Finally, we posit that a number
  of attacks are possible with a more comprehensive study of
  human perception.

    <div class='abstract'>
We conduct a security analysis of five popular web-based password managers.
Unlike ``local'' password managers, web-based password managers run in the
browser. We identify four
key security concerns for web-based password managers and, for each, identify
representative vulnerabilities through our case studies. Our attacks are severe: in
four out of the five password managers we studied, an attacker can learn a
user's credentials for arbitrary websites. We find vulnerabilities in diverse
features like one-time passwords, bookmarklets, and shared passwords. The
root-causes of the vulnerabilities are also diverse: ranging from logic and
authorization mistakes to misunderstandings about the web security model, in
addition to the typical vulnerabilities like CSRF and XSS.  
Our study suggests that it remains to be a challenge for the password managers to be secure.
To guide future
development of password managers, we 
provide guidance for password managers. Given the diversity of vulnerabilities
we identified, we advocate a defense-in-depth approach to ensure security of
password managers.

    <div class='abstract'>
      Rich client-side applications written in HTML5 proliferate
      on diverse platforms, access sensitive data, and need to maintain data-
      confinement invariants. Applications currently enforce these invariants
      using implicit, ad-hoc mechanisms. We propose a new primitive called
      a data-confined sandbox or DCS. A DCS enables complete mediation
      of communication channels with a small TCB. Our primitive extends
      currently standardized primitives and has negligible performance over-
      head and a modest compatibility cost. We retrofit our design on four
      real-world HTML5 applications and demonstrate that a small amount of
      effort enables strong data-confinement guarantees.

We empirically assess whether browser security warnings are as ineffective as
suggested by popular opinion and previous literature. We used Mozilla Firefox
and Google Chrome's in-browser telemetry to observe over 25 million warning
impressions in situ. During our field study, users continued through a
tenth of Mozilla Firefox's malware and phishing warnings, a quarter of Google
Chrome's malware and phishing warnings, and a third of Mozilla Firefox's SSL
warnings. This demonstrates that security warnings can be effective in
practice; security experts and system architects should not dismiss the goal of
communicating security information to end users. We also find that user
behavior varies across warnings. In contrast to the other warnings, users
continued through 70.2% of Google Chrome's SSL warnings. This indicates that
the user experience of a warning can have a significant impact on user
behavior. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for warning designers
and researchers.

    <div class='abstract'>
      We perform an empirical study to better understand two
      well-known vulnerability rewards programs, or VRPs,
      which software vendors use to encourage community
      participation in finding and responsibly disclosing software
      vulnerabilities. The Chrome VRP has cost approximately
      $580,000 over 3 years and has resulted in 501
      bounties paid for the identification of security vulnerabilities.
      The Firefox VRP has cost approximately $570,000
      over the last 3 years and has yielded 190 bounties. 28%
      of Chrome.s patched vulnerabilities appearing in security
      advisories over this period, and 24% of Firefox.s,
      are the result of VRP contributions. Both programs appear
      economically efficient, comparing favorably to the
      cost of hiring full-time security researchers. The Chrome
      VRP features low expected payouts accompanied by high
      potential payouts, while the Firefox VRP features fixed
      payouts. Finding vulnerabilities for VRPs typically does
      not yield a salary comparable to a full-time job; the common
      case for recipients of rewards in either program is
      that they have received only one reward. Firefox has far
      more critical-severity vulnerabilities than Chrome, which
      we believe is attributable to an architectural difference
      between the two browsers.

    <div class='abstract'>

When browsers report TLS errors, they cannot
distinguish between attacks and harmless server misconfigurations; hence they
leave it to the user to decide whether continuing is safe. However, actual
attacks remain rare. As a result, users quickly become used to ``false positives'' that
deplete their attention span, making it unlikely that they will pay sufficient
scrutiny when a real attack comes along. Consequently, browser vendors should
aim to minimize the number of low-risk warnings they report. To guide that
process, we perform a large-scale measurement study of common TLS warnings.
Using a set of passive network monitors located at different sites, we identify
the prevalence of warnings for a total population of about 300,000 users over a
nine-month period. We identify low-risk scenarios that consume a large chunk of
the user attention budget and make concrete recommendations to browser vendors
that will help maintain user attention in high-risk situations. We study 
the impact on end users with a data set much larger in scale than the data sets
used in previous TLS measurement studies.
A key novelty of our approach involves the use of internal
browser code instead of generic TLS libraries for analysis, providing more
accurate and representative results.

    <div class='abstract'>
	Application platforms provide third-party applications with access to hardware (e.g., GPS and cameras) and personal data. Many platforms use permission systems to protect access to these resources. The nature of these permission systems vary widely across platforms. Some platforms obtain user consent as part of installation, while others display runtime consent dialogs. We propose a set of guidelines to aid platform designers in determining the most appropriate permission-granting mechanism for a given permission. We apply our proposal to a smartphone platform. A preliminary evaluation indicates that our model will reduce the number of warnings presented to users, thereby reducing habituation effects.

    <div class='abstract'>
	The standard approach for privilege separation in web applications is to execute application components in different web origins. This limits the practicality of privilege separation since each web origin has financial and administrative cost. In this paper, we propose a new design for achieving effective privilege separation in HTML5 applications that shows how applications can cheaply create arbitrary number of components. Our approach utilizes standardized abstractions already implemented in modern browsers. We do not advocate any changes to the underlying browser or require learning new high-level languages, which contrasts prior approaches. We empirically show that we can retrofit our design to real-world HTML5 applications (browser extensions and rich client-side applications) and achieve reduction of 6x to  10000x in TCB for our case studies. Our mechanism requires less than 13 lines of application-specific code changes and considerably improves auditability.

    <div class='abstract'>
	While most research on XSS defense has focused on techniques for securing existing applications and re-architecting browser mechanisms, sanitization remains the industry-standard defense mechanism. By streamlining and automating XSS sanitization, web application frameworks stand in a good position to stop XSS but have received little research attention. In order to drive research on web frameworks, we systematically study the security of the XSS sanitization abstractions frameworks provide. We develop a novel model of the web browser and characterize the challenges of XSS sanitization. Based on the model, we systematically evaluate the XSS abstractions in 14 major commercially-used web frameworks. We find that frameworks often do not address critical parts of the XSS conundrum. We perform an empirical analysis of 8 large web applications to extract the requirements of sanitization primitives from the perspective of real-world applications. Our study shows that there is a wide gap between the abstractions provided by frameworks and the requirements of applications.

	We propose a formal model of web security based on an abstraction of the web platform and use this model to analyze the security of several sample web mechanisms and applications. We identify multiple distinct threat models that can be used to analyze web applications, ranging from a web attacker who controls malicious web sites and clients, to stronger attackers who can control the network and/or leverage sites designed to display user-supplied content. We propose two broadly applicable security goals and study five security mechanisms. In our case studies, which include HTML5 forms, Referer validation, and a single sign-on solution, we use a SAT-based model-checking tool to fid two previously known vulnerabilities and three new vulnerabilities. The case study of a Kerberos-based single sign-on system illustrates key differences between network protocols and web protocols and finds a vulnerability that arises because of the way cookies, redirects, and embedded links are used.

	As AJAX applications gain popularity, client-side JavaScript code is becoming increasingly complex. However, few automated vulnerability analysis tools for JavaScript exist. In this paper, we describe the first system for exploring the execution space of JavaScript code using symbolic execution. To handle JavaScript code’s complex use of string operations, we design a new language of string constraints and implement a solver for it. We build an automatic end-to-end tool, Kudzu, and apply it to the problem of finding client-side code injection vulnerabilities. In experiments on 18 live web applications, Kudzu automatically discovers 2 previously unknown vulnerabilities and 9 more than that were previously found only with a manually-constructed test suite.

	Several new browser primitives have been proposed to meet the demands of application interactivity while enabling security. To investigate whether applications consistently use these primitives safely and adequately in practice, we study the real-world usage of two client-side primitives, namely postMessage and HTML5’s client-side database storage. We examine new purely client-side communication protocols layered on postMessage (Facebook Connect, Google Friend Connect) and several real-world web applications (including Gmail, Buzz, Maps and others) which use client-side storage abstractions. We find that, in practice, these abstractions are widely used insecurely, which leads to severe vulnerabilities and can increase the attack surface for web applications in unexpected ways. We conclude the paper by offering insights into why these abstractions can be hard to use safely, and propose the economy of liabilities principle for designing future abstractions. The principle recommends that a good design for a primitive should minimize the liability that the user undertakes to ensure application security. We suggest enhancements to the existing browser primitives to make their secure use more practical.

  <p>I have been hacking over a <a
href="https://github.com/devd/Academic-Writing-Check">simple tool</a> to check
for common errors in academic writing. If you use it, I would appreciate
feedback/comments/patches.</p> <p>I was czaring the <a
href="http://security.cs.berkeley.edu/srg/" >Security Reading Group</a> at
Berkeley. <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~kevinchn/">Kevin</a> is now in
charge.</p>

  <p>The Web Security model project I worked on is now <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/websecmodel/">opensource</a>.</p> 

  <p><a href="http://webblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/2010/kaluza">Kaluza</a>, a tool I
worked on, is now available to play with <a
href="http://aerie.cs.berkeley.edu/kaluza/">online</a>. During this work, I
also wrote a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hampi/wiki/PCREToHampi">tool</a>
to convert Perl compatible regular expressions to the <a
href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/akiezun/hampi/">Hampi string solver</a> input
format. It is now part of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hampi/">Hampi
codebase</a>.</p> </div></div>
